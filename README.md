# pmasso - Admin MySQL login when already authenticated

I used this behind [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy) for then logging into the phpMyAdmin interface for 2 DB backends.

Saved the mild inconvenience of remembering passwords and behind a proper authentication system I felt relatively safe with my homemade PHP.
